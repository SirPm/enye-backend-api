# Backend Challenge - API Creation (Integrated with the exchangeratesapi.io)

# How To USE THE API

# Make a get request to the this url 'https://pm-exchange-rate-api.herokuapp.com/api/rates?base=USD&currency=EUR,INR';

# Note: The base and currency query parameter must be present for you to see the desired results

# Also you can only put one value in the base query parameter, whereas the currency query parameter can accept one or more but must be separated with a comma.

# In the case of an error in spelling, error of ommission, or any other possible errors you might encounter you'll get an error response to help you find out where the error is coming from which will help you get rid of the error.
